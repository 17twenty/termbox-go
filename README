Native Go implementation of the termbox library. Beta.

TODO:

- Fix darwin/freebsd/openbsd/netbsd build. At the moment termbox uses
  syscall.Termios structure which is not defined on these OSes. So it needs to
  be redefined manually. This plus a couple of other constants. Oh, and winsize
  structure too for TIOCGWINSZ ioctl function.
