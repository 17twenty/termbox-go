Native Go implementation of the termbox library. Beta.

Dependencies:

- Recently new code was added to work directly with terminfo database.
  So it becomes a dependency for termbox-go in order to function properly.
  In some distros terminfo database comes with "ncurses" library. As far as I
  know it comes with default MacOSX. Windows OS doesn't need such thing.

TODO:

- Add other OSes to handle termios stuff. See syscalls.go godefs template file.
- Write documentation. Need to mention how termbox-based apps can be used under
  putty (common case?).
